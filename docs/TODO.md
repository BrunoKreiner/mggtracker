## Immediate Next Steps (Start Here!)

~~1. Image Board: add local file upload from device (left sidebar, active workout, workout modal) and persist images in localStorage.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~2. Image Board UI: redesign to a 3-per-row tilted grid with short date captions; clicking an image opens a popup with the image and linked workout info.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~3. Profile picture: implement upload + localStorage persistence; use across avatar displays.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~4. Document and defer: Particle preset buttons (x20, Starfall, Twinkle) not spawning visible effects reliably; revisit later.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

~~5. Gate the entire app behind a full-screen Login/Register until authenticated.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~6. Exercise Grid: show an empty-state when no exercises match filters/search.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

1. Responsive testing and performance check (FPS, DOM node count) on desktop and mobile.
2. Add "Delete Exercise" and "Delete Set" in Active Workout UI and test end-to-end.
3. Verify difficulty mapping from Free Exercise DB and display a difficulty badge in the UI.
4. Seed the database using the Free Exercise DB importer (one-time per environment).

   - Local reset + import (DROPS ALL DATA):
     Use Windows PowerShell from repo root:
     ```powershell
     .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe backend\magical-girl-gym-tracker-backend\reset_and_import_free_db.py
     ```
   - Verify count:
     ```powershell
     $count = (Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/exercises).Count
     Write-Host "Imported $count exercises."
     ```
     Verify a specific exercise:
     ```powershell
     $exercise = Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/exercises/1
     Write-Host "Exercise 1: $($exercise.name)"
     ```
   - Note: Do NOT run this on production. We'll add a production-safe importer that only inserts if empty.
~~5. Harden authentication (input validation, duplicate email checks, error handling).~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~6. Backend deployment readiness: DATABASE_URL support, Postgres dependencies, production-safe seeding.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~7. Frontend deployment readiness: VITE_API_URL environment variable configuration.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
8. Add a rest timer between sets.

### Deployment (Vercel) - Split Project Approach
- [x] **FIXED**: Split into separate Vercel projects instead of monorepo approach
  - **Frontend Project**: Deploy `frontend/magical-girl-gym-tracker-frontend/` as separate Vite project
    - Framework auto-detection works properly
    - Root directory: `frontend/magical-girl-gym-tracker-frontend`
    - Uses `vercel.json` in frontend directory for SPA routing
  - **Backend Project**: Deploy `api/` as separate Python serverless project
    - Framework auto-detection works properly
    - Root directory: `api`
    - Uses `vercel.json` in api directory for Python runtime
  - [ ] **Setup Steps**:
  1. Create frontend Vercel project: Root Directory = `frontend/magical-girl-gym-tracker-frontend`
  2. Create backend Vercel project: Root Directory = `api`
  3. Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in frontend project to backend project URL
  4. Deploy both projects separately
  5. Ensure `api/requirements.txt` exists with backend dependencies
  6. Ensure `api/vercel.json` includes builds + routes (map `/(.*)` -> `index.py`)
  - [ ] **Environment Variables**:
    - Frontend: Set `VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-project.vercel.app` (no trailing slash)
    - Backend: Set `DATABASE_URL` for Neon database connection
  - [ ] **Post-deploy checks**:
    - Frontend: `GET /` loads index.html and `/assets/*` serve properly
    - Backend: `GET /api/exercises` returns JSON (200)
    - Backend responses include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (either `*` or your frontend domain)
    - Preflight: `OPTIONS /api/exercises` responds 200/204 and includes `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
    - Cross-origin requests work between frontend and backend projects

### Repo Hygiene
- [x] Squash noisy Vercel debug commits (last 21) into a single clean commit; keep backup branch
- [x] Squash Vercel debug commit history.

## Development Guidelines

- **Magical Girl First**: Every feature should incorporate the magical girl theme
- **Mobile Responsive**: Design for mobile-first, then scale up
- **Performance**: Keep animations smooth and app responsive
- **User Experience**: Prioritize ease of use and motivation
- **Community**: Build features that encourage positive community interaction

## Feature Prioritization

- ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**: Core functionality needed for MVP
- 🌟 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Important features for full release
- 💎 **LOW PRIORITY**: Nice-to-have features for future updates

This TODO list will be updated as development progresses and new requirements emerge.
